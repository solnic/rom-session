session
========

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/mbj/session.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/mbj/session)

State machine for connecting a business object with a database record.

This component does fit into the DM-2 ecosystem, somehow.

This is not THE [DM2.0 dm-mapper](http://github.com/solnic/dm-mapper)

Installation
------------

In your **Gemfile**

``` ruby
gem 'session', :git => 'https://github.com/mbj/session'
```

Examples
--------

Project does not have a public api currently.

Contributing
-------------

* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with Rakefile or version
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
